      <div class="poem-title">BIKING WITHOUT THE SUN</div>
      The high-beam-headlights of passing vehicles reflect off my glasses. <br>
      Dark, perfect blackness contrasts the refracted rays of glitter. <br>
      The ocean and sky would blend into one unanimous shade of blue charcoal. I'm on the edge of the earth, gliding over the invisible tar. <br>
      No street lights to guide me, no sunlight to help me, I was all alone as my wheels flew me over this empty stretch of land. <br>
      Potholes sprinkle the uninhabited road. <br>
      I'm so grateful.

      <div class="poem-title">GOING HOME</div>
      I love night-time drives,<br>
      When the dark looms and hums.<br>
      The air loosens it's grind.<br>
      Flooding down my lungs.<br><br>
      I see the ocean to my right,<br>
      As it stretches from sea to sea. <br>
      The ocean at this time of night<br>
      Slows and brings peace.<br><br>
      My eyes take it in, the whole panorama.<br>
      I feel the air thinning.<br>
      Deep, full breaths, I dump and draw.<br>
      The blanket of cold layers intimately.<br><br>
      My whole body melts into the cushions,<br>
      And finally my eyes can see,<br>
      My narrow lens starts to pull in<br>
      The darkness out around me.<br><br>
      Bigger, bigger it opens,<br>
      Like a flower in a garden.<br>
      I feel like I was the king.<br>
      Before the current's closing.<br><br>
      The ocean bends and slows<br>
      The time that I just spent,<br>
      Night skies reveal and show,<br>
      The places we used to frequent.<br><br>
      Now I know I know<br>
      The times of my very end<br>
      Now I know I know<br>
      I'm not scared to change the lens.

      <div class="poem-title">THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</div>
      I miss the single-digit days<br>
      When it was simple,<br>
      On the bus, I stayed<br>
      Watching lights outside my window twinkle.<br><br>
      Small, single-digit days of old,<br>
      I would be a passenger in my own life.<br>
      By my bus, I was controlled,<br>
      But I loved to see those lights.<br><br>
      Drawn closer to the light,<br>
      We crawled out of the bus, moving,<br>
      Praised to be of height.<br>
      They called it growing.<br><br>
      Cheers came from outside the pane.<br>
      I, as most did, left the moving bus<br>
      Knowing that the fall out would stain<br>
      My body with scratches and cuts.<br><br>
      Start walking. I can't just sit here.<br>
      Rising to my feet, I stumbled.<br>
      My legs would give, I feared.<br>
      But it was too late to stop and fumble.<br><br>
      I had to keep moving forward.<br>
      I wanted this feat,<br>
      But it's so much easier to move toward.<br>
      A goal when your in a bus seat.

      <div class="poem-title">FREQUENT FLYERS</div>
      The confusion of living, breathing minds <br>
      is taken off the backs of many who found<br>
      to frequent the skies above, choose to resign<br>
      From friends who want to see them tread the ground.<br><br>
      Do I fly more than I walk minds with minds<br>
      with you, who makes me feel so tall and far?<br>
      In that I grab at your feet from the skies<br>
      please trust, I don't want to be left alone here.<br><br>
      To be on my flight alone pulls the clouds between us, but I'm scared to fly higher,<br>
      The clouds below make me afraid of becoming what some may call a frequent flyer.

      <div class="poem-title">ROSE-TINTED</div>
      The smell of the afternoon sun <br>
      And orange lights of excitement<br>
      Would blur my morning fun<br>
      For the afternoon assignments.<br><br>
      But after the work was done<br>
      And we packed up for the next day,<br>
      Our world would have begun,<br>
      And our game would be underway.<br><br>
      Hours and hours and days and weeks,<br>
      Consumed by love to talk and fight,<br>
      We chose to skip hours of sleep,<br>
      In favor of familiar, strobing lights.<br><br>
      Now we're old, grumpy, and grown<br>
      Working to support our days of old,<br>
      Afraid to look back to happier times,<br>
      the times of flowers and rusting gold.

      <div class="poem-title">GRANDMA'S EYES</div>
      Oceans of white doomed to dry<br>
      Against the brazen sky,<br>
      The storm of sight needs the night<br>
      To love the bluest dyes.<br><br>
      Twin moons come, struggle, and tug<br>
      To close the beady eye.<br>
      It burns against fiery sun,<br>
      Hoping not to bleed and die.<br><br>
      A life that's long or short as mine<br>
      Always ends their time the same.<br>
      The earth releases it's mighty drug<br>
      To let us win the game.<br><br>
      Don't fall for the visage of phony heaven<br>
      Really, what a shame<br>
      That all we get are gates of nothing<br>
      Before we douse the flame.

      My head at the ground<br>
      I look for the shiniest specks of dirt,<br>
      And show them to the crowd.<br><br>
      Now I'm older,<br>
      Smarter and stronger<br>
      My head in the ground<br>
      Pulls out a crown of dirt<br>
      My crown, mine or theirs<br>
      I feel the former but I'm told the latter<br><br>
      I let others wear it<br>
      But when the night comes around<br>
      The crown is on my head<br>
      Sleeping with me<br><br>
      I wake up with the crown still there<br>
      Muddled in beauty, but still a. Crown<br>
      When I go to show the crowd,<br>
      They take my crown <br>
      Passed around until it falls apart<br>
      My crown is gone<br><br>
      Now nothing remains<br>
      Everyone looks<br>
      And maybe it's stll there<br>
      But deep down<br>
      I know it isn't there<br><br>
      It is cold<br>
      My head out of the ground.

      I miss when I knew where you were.<br>
      Before it happened, she was at rehab.<br>
      Every now and then, I visited her.<br>
      I shouldn't have came back.<br><br>
      She died a few months ago.<br>
      It didn't feel like a special day.<br>
      Even when she was buried down below.<br>
      It felt like she was just still away.<br><br>
      I would be by her old rehab center<br>
      That sat half a walk away from home.<br>
      Wanted and wanting will want to enter,<br>
      So, around the center, I roamed.<br><br>
      I looked into the third floor of the building,<br>
      Where I believe she still resides.<br>
      I know not to check, <br>
      Or I won't be able to hide<br>
      From the fact that she's no longer alive.

      Imagine a world where eyes could taste<br>
      The things we see and try to eat<br>
      Your favorite pie from grandmother's plate<br>
      A picture you saved to watch and feast.<br><br>
      Now imagine a fruit with glowing hues<br>
      Of red and green and yellow and blue.<br>
      Sweet and succulent it's juice must be<br>
      But it's sheen is hard and glassy.<br><br>
      I want to bite the fluorescent apple,<br>
      And taste it's exuberant pigments,<br>
      But I know my teeth will shake and raddle<br>
      Until my mouth breaks and splints.<br><br>
      So I will watch the forbidden fruit,<br>
      with tasting eyes of starving envy.<br>
      Hoping the apple will claim me the food<br>
      Grow a mouth of its own and eat me.

      We watch the people starved for food<br>
      in need of grocery money<br>
      scream in rejoice and gratitude<br>
      for what we gave them, a vat of honey.<br><br>
      My nails are buried in a leathery neck,<br>
      hands coupled around crocodile skin,<br>
      wrists are borne down on by the peck<br>

      "Stop smiling. It's not funny."<br>
      I say to the man who giggles,<br>
      "Look, look, they're stuck in honey!"<br>
      He says with eyes the shape of sickles.<br><br>
      Left hand on the right,<br>
      Right hand on the left,<br>
      Why am I laughing at this sight?<br>
      I don't know, hold my breath.

      Excited we are for the coming celebration<br>
      As we rest on the labors of our year,<br>
      Amidst our communal retrospection, <br>
      Comes the scared little winter deer.<br><br>
      Cracked, the antlers have been, for so long,<br>
      Bloody and cut thin like sticks,<br>
      The hammers and axes sing the song<br>
      Of Prometheus as they cut bit by bit.<br><br>
      Crack and crick and notch and nip,<br>
      The bones we harvest and scan,<br>
      Happy, we leave, with all the chips<br>
      Of boney gold in our hands.<br><br>
      The crippled deer, sad and broken, hides away<br>
      To heal his missing horns.<br>
      The antlers grow with cracks that ache<br>
      Afraid of the next winter storm.<br><br>
      It's not like we don't know where the cracks lead.<br>
      They beg us to ask the question:<br>
      What will we do when it's time to leave our home of burning heaven?
